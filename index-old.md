# Updates

Dear all,

the wedding is now a month away! Ethan and I cannot wait to see you and celebrate our marriage together! 
A few logistical updates first:

We set up a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LP7XYf56kV703ZLHnGwH4H7QZds6baYzsP4VDncw0Ns/edit?usp=sharing) for carpooling and ride sharing. If you need a ride or you have a car and have seats available type up your information, including your contact info and your date and time of arrival. 

Second, if you are staying or intend to stay at the Palms Hotel, please say so on this other [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AuXi1MT7f4kClFAMR_qvWEw9s9_TGAwXMHPKjLU5pzQ/edit?usp=sharing), including which nights (Friday and Saturday night, Saturday night only,...). I personally cannot wait to meet Greg, the owner, in person: he seems quite a character!

That's it for now!
Love,

Marta
