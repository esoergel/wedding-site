# Bridesmaids

Chiara Marello: Maid of Honor

She's my sister, my "Sisterina" aka as Kiki. During our first encounter (I was 2 years and 2 weeks old) she gave me a beautiful 
swing as present: it was love at first sight! She's my partner in crime and we shared a lifetime together full of laughs, some tears,
many games when we were younger and adventures when we got older. She's the best gift my parents could give me.

Valeria Graziano: Bridesmaid

Vale and I went trough the rough times of middle school and high school together, where for 75% of the time we were "compagne di banco"
or deskmates -the person you sit next to for an entire year. She's one of the most artsy and creative person I know. She is a nurse and
lives near Asti with her boyfriend Stefano in their new house.

Irene Cravero: Bridesmaid

I met Ire in Torino on my first day of college and immediately became friends. Outside school, we explored the city nightlife (remember
the supercafone party?!) and kept in touch even when studying abroad: she visited me in Florida and I visited her in Lyon, France. She 
works for Juventus (best soccer team) and lives near Torino with her boyfriend Roberto.

Leeann Sullivan: Bridesmaid

Leeann and I were in the same program at BU. She decided that we were going to be friends and after a night spent talking while sipping 
cider I realized she was right. Magically, our boyfriends got along too and we hung out almost every week, whether hiking
partying, or exploring the city together. In 2014 she moved to Colorado to pursue a PhD, where she lives with her husband Alex and 
Delphi (the cat aka da Dooze).


# Groomsmen

Nathaniel Soergel: Best Man 

Nat has known Ethan since the ripe young age of 3 and a half. Nat lives in Atlantic Beach with his dog Hadley.

Dylan Goelz: Groomsman

Dylan and Ethan have been friends since pre-school. Dylan lives in San Francisco with his wife Mel and their dog Radley.

Ezequiel Zylberberg: Groomsman

Aka Zeke, Ethan met him in college when they both joined the student organization TRiP (Travel and Recreation Program). They share the love of the outdoors, biking and very very long discussions about the world's problems and ways of fixing them. Zeke just recently moved to Cambridge with her fiancee Ges.

Camila Mateo: Groomslady

Ethan met Camila in Boston through Zeke and immediately became friends. They share a passion for movies and whiskey. Camila lives in Cambridge with her girlfriend Jess and Willhelm the cat.
