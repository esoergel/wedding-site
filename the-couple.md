# How we met: 

We didn’t know each other until we got stuck on a 3 by 2 (or 1,5 squared meters) sunfish, which is a small, light sailboat with only one sail. We weren’t running away from pirates or trying to survive a hurricane: as an exchange student in Florida, Marta had joined TRiP’s sailing trip, where Ethan was one of the outdoor guides. His hair was still long.

As the most experienced sailor Ethan was assigned to the sunfish while the rest of the leaders were going to sail mini-catamarans. Marta was late and had arrived at the site second-to-last, when everybody except for another guy had chosen the mini-catamarans. She felt adventurous and as Ethan tried to lure one of the two late-comers to the sunfish, Marta volunteered. 
For the next two hours, Marta and Ethan peacefully sailed in the inter-coastal talking about the art of sailing, travels, languages and probably Italian food. They even saw dolphins!
On our first date we watched [Cool Runnings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_VMr3k152I) –“I see pride! I see power! I see a badass mother who won’t take no crap off of nobody!”- while dunkin’ chocolate chips cookies in milk. When [Ethan](https://m.xkcd.com/458/) tried to kiss Marta, she turned the other way. Marta was on the wrong side of history. Thankfully she realized her mistake!

# The proposal:

Fast-forward to March 2016. Seven years and many adventures after that epic night, Ethan and Marta were travelling in Cambodia, on a 50CC scooter in the Cardamom mountains to go see the Tatai waterfall on the homonym river. At the right moment, Ethan and Marta swam behind the falls, in a private, romantic spot. 
The rest was pretty much like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtIUZBV9Ka4). Thanks Leeann for finding this gem!
