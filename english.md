Dear friends travelling from the US and Ireland,

Ethan and I are delighted that you will be joining us for the Italian celebrations of our wedding. Given the precedents, be sure to bring an umbrella..
Jokes aside, the reception will be held on Friday September 15th at the "Vecchio castagno" restaurant located in fraz. Maroero by Cocconato d'Asti. The gathering will start at noon. As this is located about 40 minutes away from Asti, we will organize a shuttle bus to transport guests from Asti to the restaurant in the morning and the reverse at night. More details on the shuttle pick-up location will be posted here closer to the date.

As for the days you will be spending in Asti, below you find a tentative plan that will be updated in early September. You are welcome to join all of these activities but do not feel obligated to! 

Tuesday September 12th: Visit to Cinque Terre. We will leave by train early in the morning from Asti and will spend the day walking, relaxing, swimming, and eating focaccia between Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso. We will catch the train back from Monterosso in mid-afternoon and be back in Asti by nightfall.

Most of you will arrive in Asti on September 13th. The tentative plan is to host a welcome aperitif at my house (via San Martino, 21) that night. 

Thursday September 14th will be dedicated to visiting the town. We can meet in front of my house and roam around: the 2 things I think you should see are the house where the famous poet [Vittorio Alfieri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Alfieri) was born and the Cripta of Sant'Anastasio where you can see the remnants of construction of Roman times (700 A.C.). To learn more about Asti, visit the tourism office [website](http://www.astiturismo.it/en) for more information. At 9PM we will go see the Palio degli sbandieratori that is the competition of the [flag-throwers](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sbandieratori&t=ffab&iax=1&ia=images).

Friday September 15th: reception and party time!

Saturday September 16th: breakfast together at CafeLait (via Roero, at the intersection with corso Alfieri), visit to the local market (and some shopping for the ladies!). Visit of the [Douja d'Or](http://www.doujador.it/douja-dor-english/), a wine festival with tastings and opportunity to purchase local wines. 

Sunday September 17th: Palio parade at 2PM and [Palio](http://www.comune.asti.it/index.php?id_sezione=943) starting at 4PM.
