# Honeymoon Fund and Charity
A number of people have asked us what they can give us for our wedding.  We've got a small apartment and plan on moving around in the next several years, so there's not much we're looking for now. For this reason, if you'd like to give us something, the simplest is to contribute towards our honeymoon!  We're going to be donating a portion of what we receive to a cool charity, but you are encouraged to instead give to the charity directly, as you see fit.

# About the Charity
Traveling for work, last year Ethan visited Burkina Faso, a very poor country in West Africa.  While he was there, he met with a charity called [TuaRes](http://www.tuares.org/en/) to see if Ethan's company could work with them.  The partnership didn't work out, but Ethan was very impressed with the organization, the people, and above all, their mission.

Less than half of the girls in Burkina Faso finish primary school.  TuaRes provides meaningful, direct support to girls to help them attend school, have fewer, healthier children, and earn higher incomes.  Social workers follow the girls in this program and address the issues that prevent them from obtaining an education.  They provide meals at school for the girls, and food and financial aid to the families to offset the cost of allowing their daughters to attend school (rather than help out at home and work).  They also include things as simple as glasses to see the chalkboard or a bicycle to make the long commute more manageable.  TuaRes also trains girls in life skills not taught in school.  There's much more to it than we can detail here; check out the video on their [website](http://www.tuares.org/en/) for more!
