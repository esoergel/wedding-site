# Updates

Dear all,

the wedding is now a month away! Ethan and I cannot wait to see you and celebrate our marriage together. 
A few logistical updates first:

We set up a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LP7XYf56kV703ZLHnGwH4H7QZds6baYzsP4VDncw0Ns/edit?usp=sharing) for carpooling and ride sharing. If you need a ride or you have a car and have seats available type up your information, including your contact info and your date and time of arrival. 

Second, if you are staying or intend to stay at the Palms Hotel, please say so on this other [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AuXi1MT7f4kClFAMR_qvWEw9s9_TGAwXMHPKjLU5pzQ/edit?usp=sharing), including which nights (Friday and Saturday night, Saturday night only,...). I personally cannot wait to meet Greg, the owner, in person: he seems quite a character!

That's it for now!
Love,

Marta 


# Accomodation

We have a block of 11 rooms reserved at the [Palms Hotel](http://www.palmsretro.com/) for Saturday night. Market rate is normally between $139 and $169, however if you mention Marta and Ethan's wedding ALL rooms will be $129 for Saturday night. If there is enough interest to book all rooms for Friday night and/or Sunday I can try to get the discount for those night. Please email me (marta.marello@gmail.com) for interest in addition to Saturday night.

The Palms is a small, exotic hotel located near Town Center, the main road that divides Atlantic Beach from Neptune Beach, which is where all the bars, cafes and restaurants are. This is about a mile away from the ceremony location. The hotel has been recently renovated and offers complimentary bikes and surf boards to guests. Ethan and I stayed here a couple of years ago and we really enjoyed it!

There is also a Holiday Inn about a mile inland from the location of the ceremony that is definitely an option.

# Getting here

The closest airport is Jacksonville, FL (JAX). There is really no good transportation from Jacksonville to Atlantic Beach, except if you rent a car o get a ride. I've been told that you can also Uber for around 30$.

Other options include flying into Miami (MIA) or Orlando (MCO) and then take a bus (Greyhound) or train (Amtrak) or a short flight to Jacksonville.
