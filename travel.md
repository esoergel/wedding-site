# Accomodation

We have a block of 11 rooms reserved at the [Palms Hotel](http://www.palmsretro.com/) for Saturday night. Market rate is normally between $139 and $169, however if you mention Marta and Ethan's wedding ALL rooms will be $129for Saturday night. If there is enough interest to book all rooms for Friday night and/or Sunday I can try to get the discount for those night. Please email me (marta.marello@gmail.com) for interest in addition to Saturday night.

The Palms is a small, exotic hotel located near Town Center, the main road that divides Atlantic Beach from Neptune Beach, which is where all the bars, cafes and restaurants are. This is about a mile away from the ceremony location. The hotel has been recently renovated and offers complimentary bikes and surf boards to guests. Ethan and I stayed here a couple of years ago and we really enjoyed it!

There is also a Holiday Inn about a mile inland from the location of the ceremony that is definitely an option.

# Getting here

The closest airport is Jacksonville, FL (JAX). There is really no good transportation from Jacksonville to Atlantic Beach, except if you rent a car o get a ride. 

Other options include flying into Miami (MIA) or Orlando (MCO) and then take a bus (Greyhound) or train (Amtrak) or a short flight to Jacksonville.
